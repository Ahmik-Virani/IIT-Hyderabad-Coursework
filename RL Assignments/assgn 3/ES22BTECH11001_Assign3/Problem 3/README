# Reinforcement Learning Assignment 3

This Project is made by : Ahmik Virani.
Roll Number : ES22BTECH11001.

## Files
For this problem I have submitted the following files
- CartPole.ipynb : A python notebook where I have run the experiments and stored the results and made the necessary graphs using the gym environment - CartPole-v0
- LunarLander.ipynb : A python notebook where I have run the experiments and stored the results and made the necessary graphs using the gym environment - LunarLander-v3
- script.py : This is the python script which was asked in the question and can be run from the terminal

## Instructions to run script.py
1. Enter the following command in the folder of script.py to run the python file
``` bash
python script.py
```

2. You will be as asked to enter the configurations, please enter them without any spelling mistakes
- Type exactly either : "LunarLander-v3" or "CartPole-v0" for the environment
- Type exactly either : "True" or "False" for the reward-to-go and advantage normalization
- Type a natural in the number of iterations
- Type a natural number in the batch size
- Enter a real number between 0 and 1 for the discount rate and learning rate
- Enter a natural number for the hidden layer size of the neural network

3. Please note that you would need to wait for some time for this script to run

4. Once successfully run, this would display the learning curves, after which you can close the program
