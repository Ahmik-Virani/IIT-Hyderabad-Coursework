This assignment is about Socket Programming

### Conifiguring Mininet Prompt
1. Open the terminal, and go to “/home/p4/tutorials/exercises/basic”
2. Run "make clean"
3. Run "make run"

## Deployment

Please note: These are the syntaxes followed for the HTTP requests:

1. PUT
```bash
"PUT /assignment1/key1/val1 HTTP/1.1"
```
2. GET
```bash
"GET /assignment1?request=key1 HTTP/1.1"
```

3. DELETE
```bash
"DELETE /assignment1/key1 HTTP/1.1"
```

1. Client Server without Cache

To open the host terminals, run the below commands:

```bash
xterm h1
```
```bash 
xterm h2
```
<br><br>
Note: that first you need to open the server socket before running the client

To make the server socket listening, run on Node h2:
```bash
bash h2-arp.sh
```
Followed by:
```bash 
python server.py
```

To send requests from the client, run on Node h1:
```bash 
bash h1-arp.sh
```
Followed by:
```bash 
python client.py
```
Enter the destination IP address in the following input prompt as a string(in quotation marks)
```bash
Enter dstIP: 
```
Enter the HTTP request in the following input prompt as a string(in quotation marks)
```bash
Enter the request:
```

2. Client Server with Cache

To open the host terminals, run the below commands:

```bash
xterm h1
```
```bash
xerm h2
```
```bash
xterm h3
```
Note: that first you need to open the server socket and cache before running the client



To make the server socket listening, run on Node h3:
```bash 
bash h3-arp.sh
```
Followed by:
```bash
python server.py
```

To make the cache socket active, run on Node h2:
```bash
bash h2-arp.sh
```
Followed by 
```bash 
python cache.py
```

Finally, to send requests from client, run on Node h1:
```bash 
bash h1-arp.sh
```
Followed by:
```bash
python client.py
```

Enter the destination IP address in the following input prompt as a string(in quotation marks)
```bash
Enter dstIP: 
```
Enter the HTTP request in the following input prompt as a string(in quotation marks)
```bash
Enter the request:
```
