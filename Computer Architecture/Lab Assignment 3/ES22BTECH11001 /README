# Computer Architecture - CS2323, Lab-3

This Project is made by : Ahmik Virani <br>
Roll Number : ES22BTECH11001 <br>

This assignment is about making a RISC-V Assembler. Given RISC-V assembly code, converting it to its equivalent machine code.

### Input File

The input file is named "input.s"
The contents of this are RISC-V instructions. Note that only the instructions as mentioned in the assignment are accepted and any other instruction nor any pseudo instructions are accepted.
  
  
### Before Running
  1. Make sure that an Ubuntu Machine is used
  2. Ensure that an input.s file exists
  
## Deployment

Run the following command on the terminal

```bash
make
```
Followed by 
```bash
./riscv_asm
```

On executing the make command, the Makefile will run and create the riscv_asm executible file along with the object file named : "ES22BTECH11001_Source_Code.o"

### Output file

All the machine codes in hexadecimal will output into the file named "output.hex".

### Output in terminal

In case of an error in input, the code will be exited immediately and the error message and corresponding line number will be displayed on the terminal. 
<br> Note: The error definition is probable and may no be 100% satisfying, however the line number will be accurate.

### After the testing

You can run
```bash
make clean
```

The above command will delete the object files and executable files.
